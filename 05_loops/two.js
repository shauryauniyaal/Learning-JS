// DO WHILE LOOP

// let score = 1

// do {
//     console.log(`Score is ${score}`);
//     score ++
// } while (score <= 10);

// BUT

let score = 11

do {
    console.log(`Score is ${score}`);
    score ++
} while (score <= 10); 

// this will still work as code is executed first and then the condition is checked

// this is fixed in for and while loops
